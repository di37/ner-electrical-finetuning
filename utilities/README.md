# Folder - `utilities`

This folder includes helper functions that assist with creating model repositories in Hugging Face accounts, creating model cards, pushing models to the hub, and cleaning and grouping overlapped entities. `constants.py` includes parameters that can be changed. This allows the code to remain unchanged while only requiring modifications to the values in `constants.py`.
